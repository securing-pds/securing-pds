# Code release

The code in this directory allows to replicate the plots regarding the load factors of PRF-wrapped insertion-only Cuckoo filters and the concrete secure instances proposed in the paper.

The code should be run using Sagemath 9+, together with the extra `tqdm` and `pandas` libraries.
These can be installed inside Sage by running
```
$ sage -sh
(sage-sh) pip3 install pandas
(sage-sh) pip3 install tqdm
(sage-sh) exit
```

Examples for running the code can be found in the Makefile.
